"# My First Git Repository" 

My name is Jayson Bartels

A little background about me is that I love to play video games, and have always been a fan of computers and the stuff they can do.

I'm Learning C++ to better my understanding of how to code and broaden my skills in coding.

I'm familiar with Python and C# and have been programing for almost 2 years on and off.

Some things I enjoy to do is drawing and playing video games.
